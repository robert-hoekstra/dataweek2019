            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>A lot of birds live and breed in Amsterdam but do they enjoy the hard noises of traffic and other city noises? How much do we know about the birds living in our city, and where do these noises appear in Amsterdam?
                This website aims to provide visitors a look at how birds behave so you can explore the data yourself in where the noises are generated and where they breed.
                For demonstration purposes, we decided to focus on the data from Amsterdam, which provides data on high decibel areas and breeding places of birds.</p>

             <div>
            <p>The road datasets provided us with a lot of different information about Amsterdam and the noise-polution. By exploring this data it shows you all the areas which produce a lot of noise (dB 50+). Do you notice it too? The common road tends to produce a lot of (dB). These roads have in common that they produce a lot of noise because of public transports or trucks.</p>

            <div>
            <p>The dataset of Schiphol was an interesting one. It shows the route in which planes land and take off, but also the area in which these routes generate noise. Do you see the huge blop that covers a lot of the western- and southern areas of Amsterdam? It shows how the noise covers these areas. It is already a common fact that the planes generate a lot of noise but who would have thought it was that much!</p>

                <p>The industrial area datasets give you a view on where these areas are within Amsterdam.
                    These areas tend to generate a lot of noise which tends to scare off birds into breeding in these areas. Maybe you already know these locations in which these areas are located, most of these are located in the outer ring of Amsterdam or in the harbor area of Amsterdam. Who would have known that these locations cover a lot of areas?</p>

            <div>
            <p>The breeding location dataset shows us the location and the number of birds in a specified location. But this is interesting! Why do they breed far away from the noise? Maybe they donâ€™t breed when it is noisy? It is funny to see that most of them avoid the busy areas of Amsterdam and prefer a more quiet location.</p>

            <div>
            <p>One would say that birds love trees and parks but somehow that is not the case. Maybe it is warmer in urban areas than in those quiet cold parks? Who would have thought that they still seek some noise in urban areas instead of some lovely parks?</p>

            <p>It is safe to say that birds don't like to breed in noisy areas. They seem to find a nice spot near buildings that is not to noisy. Airtraffic and industrial noisepollution create an area where birds don't like to breed.
